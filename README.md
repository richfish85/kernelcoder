# 🔧 KernelCoder
*A next-gen interactive learning platform for low-level programming and systems fundamentals. Part of the cybersecurity skill building module by DeepNet*

---

## 🧠 Overview

KernelCoder is an interactive, web-based training ground for learning how computers *actually* work — from the bare metal up. Inspired by Codecademy, but purpose-built for aspiring hackers, system programmers, reverse engineers, and OS hobbyists.

> **Tagline:**
> *"Learn from the bottom up. Code from the core."*

## ✨ Selling Points

| ✅ Hands-on from the first minute | 🧠 Learn why it works, not just what to type | 🔒 Safe command sandbox – practice without fear |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⚙️ Languages covered: Bash, C, Assembly (with more coming) | 🧑‍💻 For future hackers, engineers & makers | |

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- ✅ Demystify low-level programming concepts through hands-on exploration
- ✅ Provide an intuitive, gamified learning experience
- ✅ Build secure, sandboxed environments for code execution
- ✅ Support multiple learning paths (Assembly, C, reverse engineering, OS dev)
- ✅ Offer immediate feedback, progression tracking, and community features

## 📚 Learning Tracks (WIP)

Each track contains interactive modules and challenge-based progression:

### 🧱 Track 1: *Understanding the Machine*
- Binary & Hex
- Memory layout: Stack vs Heap
- CPU architecture, buses, and I/O
- Assembly language (x86, NASM)

### ⚙️ Track 2: *Systems Programming in C*
- Pointers and manual memory management
- File I/O and system calls
- Building your own shell

### 🧵 Track 3: *OS From Scratch*
- Bootloaders and kernels
- Interrupts and drivers
- Displaying text via memory-mapped I/O

### 🔍 Track 4: *Reverse Engineering & Exploitation*
- GDB, objdump, strace
- Buffer overflows and mitigations
- Writing simple exploits in C

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project emphasizes security, scalability, and interactivity without using `<canvas>`.

### 📦 Backend
- **Node.js** or **FastAPI (Python)** – Core API
- **Docker** – Code execution sandboxes (user-isolated)
- **PostgreSQL** – User data, progress tracking
- **Redis** – Session/cache management

### 🧑‍💻 Frontend
- **React** (Vite or Next.js) – Dynamic interface
- **TailwindCSS** – Clean, responsive design
- **Monaco Editor** – VSCode-like code input with syntax highlighting
- **xterm.js** (optional) – Terminal emulation for interactive shell tasks

### 🔎 Code Execution & Grading
- Containerized execution environments:
  - GCC for C tasks
  - NASM/YASM for x86 assembly
- Python grading scripts for validating output and memory usage
- In-browser syntax + compile error feedback

### 📦 Optional Tools
- **WebAssembly (WASM)** – Run limited local code in-browser for intro modules
- **GitHub OAuth / Firebase** – Authentication (for MVP)

---

## 🚦 Project Phases

### Phase 1: MVP
- Static lessons and code editor (no login needed)
- Code validation via output matching
- Markdown-based lesson engine
- Basic C & ASM challenge bank

### Phase 2: Auth + User Profiles
- Save progress, XP system, levels
- Personal dashboard with completed challenges
- Leaderboards and community challenge creation

### Phase 3: Advanced Interactivity
- Embedded terminal interface
- Full sandbox environment for kernel/bootloader projects
- Visual stack/heap/memory map diagrams (DOM/SVG based)

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- All code runs in isolated containers with resource/time limits
- Rate-limiting on code execution
- Sanitized input/output logging
- File access restrictions for all challenges

---

## 🚧 Status

> 🚀 Early Planning Stage  
> ✅ Tech stack defined  
> 🔜 Prototyping playground and lesson engine

---
